Usage:
Run game by compiling and running RunGame.java
Use arrow keys to move player model. Use space
bar to throw pokeballs. Press indicated buttons
in window to also move character. Catch them all!

Summary:
Basic implementation of Pokemon JRPG elements. Uses
JRPG image and sprites to run a customized game of
Pokemon. Filled with hundreds of pokemon that user
can catch. Contains library and index of sprites that is 
customizable and chageable in code with ability
to change movement patterns, spawn time and 
frequency, and spawn area. Modable characters 
and even player model can be modded. 

Potential Improvements:
Basic elements/tools written for expansion of game
to full map of Pokemon JRPG style games but requires
commentation and codified abstraction to become 
comprehensize RPG editor. No incentives or game story
elements implemented. No fighting elements implemented.
